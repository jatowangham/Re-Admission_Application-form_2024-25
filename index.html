                   <h3><span class="yellow">  2. Introduction of Academic Management System - ERP Linways</span></h3>
                   <p>Linways, established in 2009, is a cloud-based learning platform provider for higher educational 
                    institutions. Linways simplify all the managerial tasks of an institution with the Academic Management 
                    System (AMS). It also ensures the best user experience for faculty, students, managerial board and 
                    parents.  Linways is catering to 250+ institutions across India. 
                     With the introduction of the ERP programme Linways, our college is advancing in technology and 
                    making the work of faculty, students, parents and management hustle-free. Documentations, daily 
                    attendance of students, Internal and external Examinations, monitoring of the academic performance of 
                    students and documentations for the next cycle of NAAC Accreditation are made easy through Linways.  
                    Faculty Login, Student Login and Parent Login will make the dissemination of information easier and 
                    accessible to all the stakeholders. Linways is an expensive software and we are paying Rs. 30 per month 
                    for each student and an additional charge of 5% to the total price annually from next year.   To meet the 
                    expenses, we have added Rs. 360 to the total college fees (ERP Linways - Rs. 30x12=Rs.360). </p>

                    <h3><span class="yellow">3. Review of the Policy on Security Deposit</span></h3>
                    <p>The Management, Discipline Committee and the Student Council of the college had the Review of the 
                        Policy on Security Deposit on 6th May 2024 and arrived at the following decisions:</p>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li><span class="cyan">To reduce the Security Deposit by Rs. 2000/-.</span>  In the old system a student had to pay Rs. 2500 per 
                                Semester and the total amount for two Semesters was Rs. 5000/-.  It was decided to reduce Rs. 2000 
                                and make the total amount to Rs. 3000/- for two Semesters.</li>
                            <li><span class="cyan">One time payment of Security Deposit:</span> In the old system a student had to pay Security Deposit twice 
                                a year for securing less than 75% attendance.  It was decided that a student who secures less than 
                                75% attendance will pay the Security Deposit of Rs. 3000/- at the beginning of the academic year for 
                                the whole year.  Please refer to page no 23 of Prospectus 2024-25 for better clarity.</li>
